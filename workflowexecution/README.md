# ![](icon.svg) Workflow Execution

Custom view that shows a button to trigger a data Workflow execution of specified blocks.

The view allows you to specify a list of blocks to execute. It shows a simple HTML button to start the workflow job and shows the
status of the job optionally.
It's a simple wrapper around the [Workflow Execution REST API](https://help.visokio.com/support/solutions/articles/42000073133-workflow-execution-rest-apis). 

## Settings

 - Blocks : the list of block names, comma separated, to execute.
